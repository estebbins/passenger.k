# Passenger.k

# Description:
Inspired by the mundane, this gameplay explores the experience of a passenger on a plane waiting for their flight to take off. This is a time-based point & click adventure designed to be played multiple times, each time trying a different set of actions to see how they effect the outcome. The player will interact with the seatback in front of them, solve puzzles, and complete NPC interactions, all while keeping themselves entertained and their sanity level high. Keep an eye on how each action (or reaction) impacts entertainment, sanity, and departure meters, and modify your approach next time to see if you can generate a different outcome. Try to make it to your departure time without dying of boredom or losing all of your sanity! Enjoy exploring all the possible outcomes!
