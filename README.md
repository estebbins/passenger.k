# Passenger.k

# Description:
Inspired by the mundane, this gameplay explores the experience of a passenger on a plane whose flight is getting delayed repeatedly.  The passenger will have to solve puzzles and complete additional time-based tasks, and NPC interactions, all while keeping themselves entertained and their sanity level high. As their sanity level goes down, the game will get increasingly more difficult as they response options will have bigger impacts on their meters, making it more difficult to get to take-off successfully. Survive the plane delays and successfully take off, or die in several creative ways. Enjoy exploring all the possible outcomes!
